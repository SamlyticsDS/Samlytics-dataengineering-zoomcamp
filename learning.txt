confirm "Docker" is installed by just typing "docker"
Docker is a containerization software that allows us to isolate software in a similar way to virtual machines but in a much leaner way.

to confirm docker is well installed run
docker run hello-world

i can run an interative container with below
docker run -it ubuntu
to install python in our new environment
apt update
apt install python3

to exit back to my host machines
ctrl d
 to go back I can run
 docker run -it ubuntu 
it opens new image hence docker is stateless.

We can run a Python image
docker run -it python:3.13.
docker run -it python:3.13.11-slim  for smaller version
docker run -it --entrypoint=bash python:3.13.11-slim  For bash with python

Above have python by default
to see all previous Docker images
docker ps -a
to get the list of all docker images ids
docker ps -aq
to remove all listed files
docker rm `docker ps -aq`

to see what is available in my environment
docker ps -a

How to preserve stateless
> mkdir test   £Make a folder
> cd test/ £move to the folder
> ls  £list files in the folder
> touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt  £create files in the folder
> echo "Hello from host"> file1.txt £write text in a file
> ls £list files
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt
> cat file1.txt £View content of a file
Hello from host
> cat file2.txt £View content of a file
> touch script.py £ This create a new file
I can run this script with
Python script.py
How do i run this script from a docker
cd .. £ to root directory
# we do volume mapping with -V $(pwd)/test: /app/test
docker run -it  -v $(pwd)/test:/app/test --entrypoint=bash python:3.13.11-slim
# then all the linux functions applies
root@bfb0856598de:/# ls
app  boot  etc   lib    media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
bin  dev   home  lib64  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var
root@bfb0856598de:/# cd app/
root@bfb0856598de:/app# ls
test
root@bfb0856598de:/app# cd test/
root@bfb0856598de:/app/test# ls
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt  script.py
root@bfb0856598de:/app/test# python script.py

# create virtual environment within your workspace to install all required library
pip install uv
uv init --python 3.13  #initiate the virtual environment with python 3.13
uv run python -V create the virtual environment
uv run which python # to verify virtual environment python
which python # To verufy the code space python

# pyproject.toml notes the environment dependencies
to add libraries use
uv add pandas pyarrow

Then specify to the environment to use the uv python going forward
just use "uv run python filename.py" to use venv python 

#to commit all changes to git use the following
git status  # to view the status of all unadded files
git add .  # To add all the files
cd .. # go to the root
git commit -m 'pipeline' # to commit changes with message

To create my Docker image
We create Dockerfile that describe how I build the image

go to the Docker folder and do
docker run -t test:pandas  . # -t is for task where test is the taskname and . means build in current directory
